# Hermit-Crab-V2-DragonUHF-TH
ALPHA STATUS
This design is currently untested due to issues with the CAN board on my Hermit crab 2

This is a full toolhead for use on the Hermit Crab V2 and designed for the Dragon UHF with extender. The design allows for either 5015 or 5020 blowers and utilised the following
- Orbitor 2 (LDO)
- Phaetus Dragon UHF with extender
- BTT microprobe
- Hermit crab V2 canbus (obviously)
- 30x10 fan - axial
- 2x 5020 blower or 2x 5015 blowers (There are ducts for both but not tested the 5015 version)
- Heatset inserts (M3x4x4) or 5mm deep ones will work too.
- Suggest ASA for printing and its 2 parts only - the Main unibody and the duct 
- Expected total weight including hermit crab and mgn12h carraige is sub 450g
